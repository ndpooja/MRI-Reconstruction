# MRI-Reconstruction
Retropsective and prospective analysis (reconstruction) of low field MRI (7.8 mT) for different acquisitions

* VLMFRI_CartesianProspective.ipynb - Reconstruction of image using cartesian raw data
* VLMFRI_RadialProspective.ipynb - Reconstruction of image using radial acquisition
* VLMFRI_SPARKLING_ProspectiveAnalysis.ipynb - Reconstruction of image using SPARKLING acquired data
* VLMFRI_SPARKLING_RetrospectiveAnalysis.ipynb - Retrospective analysis of SPARKLING trajectories with full cartesian data

* To run SPARKLING related files you can make request to the authors of SPARKLING to access the SPARKLING related libraries
* In order to run Cartesian & Radial install required packages
